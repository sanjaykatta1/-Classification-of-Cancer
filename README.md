  Molecular Classification of Cancer by Gene Expression Monitoring
 
 Dataset
 
 ● The dataset has been retrieved from the gene expression dataset evidently
demonstrated in the study(Golub et al.)
 
 ● The dataset contains samples from bone marrow and peripheral blood.
 
 ● It contains the quantification of the samples for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute
lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).
 
 ● The data has been retrieved from 78 patients with a total of 7200 attributes.

 
 Data Preprocessing

● The Gene expression dataset contains 7200 gene descriptions, which all
constitute the different attributes of the dataset.

● Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed to reduce the
dimensionality of the dataset.
● The final number of features left in the dataset after PCA is 32.
